#!/bin/bash
# 03-process.sh — stage 3 of 4: process
#
# USAGE:
#   ./03-process.sh
#
# REQUIREMENTS:
#   - bash, claude (Claude Code CLI) on $PATH
#   - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY in env (or an active Claude Code login)
#   - 02-clean.sh has already run and populated ./work/02-clean/
#
# WHAT IT DOES:
#   Calls `claude -p` on each cleaned file with a beat-analysis prompt.
#   Asks for key facts, named entities, and unverified claims as JSON-shaped
#   output. Writes one .json file per input.
#
#   Tip: for streaming progress on large batches, swap the call for
#     claude -p --output-format stream-json "$PROMPT ..."
#   and parse incrementally with jq.
#
# INPUT:
#   ./work/02-clean/*.txt
#
# OUTPUT:
#   ./work/03-processed/<basename>.json
#
# OWNS:    the model call and the prompt shape
# HANDS OFF TO: 04-save.sh
