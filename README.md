# Advanced prompt engineering for journalists — starter kit

A starter repo for the [Knight Center](https://knightcenter.utexas.edu/) MOOC on using AI coding tools from the command line. Fork this repo, clone your fork, `cd` into it, and run `claude`. Everything you need for the four modules is already here.

## What this repo is

Your workspace for all four modules. By the end of the course, it'll be a working AI-assisted journalism toolkit you've filled in with your own beat details — documented, version-controlled, and shareable.

- A **context file scaffold** (`CLAUDE.md`) with teaching comments and a fully worked example
- **Memory and lessons files** (`MEMORY.md`, `LESSONS.md`) showing the patterns from video A2
- **Real Claude Code skills** (`skills/`) with YAML frontmatter — the shape from video B1
- **Slash commands** (`.claude/commands/`) for beat briefings, SIFT-based claim checks, and cross-model review
- **A one-way-door hook** (`.claude/hooks.json`) — the guardrail pattern
- **A minimal plugin skeleton** (`plugin/`) — the shape from video B2
- **Staged pipeline scripts** (`scripts/pipeline/`) — the fetch → clean → process → save pattern
- **A GitHub Actions workflow** (`.github/workflows/weekly-digest.yml`) — the cloud-detect side of the hybrid pattern
- **Module 4 documentation** (`docs/context-management.md`, `docs/cross-model-review.md`, `docs/four-questions.md`)
- **A worked mini example** (`examples/mamdani-mini/`) — the shape of the video B1 pipeline demo with synthetic data
- **Sample journalism documents** (`sample-docs/`) — fictional Greenfield city council beat fixtures
- **Stubs for Codex and Gemini users** (`AGENTS.md`, `GEMINI.md`) — if you're not using Claude

Everything in the repo maps to a specific module and video in [docs/module-map.md](docs/module-map.md). Start there if you want the index.

## Getting started

### 1. Fork this repo

Click **Fork** at the top right of the GitHub page. That gives you your own copy you can push to freely.

### 2. Clone your fork

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/mooc-starter-kit.git
cd mooc-starter-kit
```

Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your GitHub username.

### 3. Install one AI CLI tool

You need Node.js (version 20+) and one of these:

| Tool | Install | Cost |
|------|---------|------|
| **Claude Code** | `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` | Requires a Claude subscription or API key |
| **Gemini CLI** | `npm install -g @google/gemini-cli` | Free tier: 1,000 requests/day with a Google account |
| **Codex CLI** | `npm install -g @openai/codex` | Requires an OpenAI API key |

The course exercises are shown in Claude Code. The patterns work in all three tools. If you're using Codex, see `AGENTS.md`. If you're using Gemini, see `GEMINI.md`.

### 4. Run it

```bash
cd mooc-starter-kit
claude
```

Your first session should be boring on purpose — say hi, type `/init` (if you're in Claude Code) and see what it does, read `CLAUDE.md`, and then pick up the [Module 1 exercise](https://mooc.amditis.tech/module-1/) on the course site.

## Which module uses what

| Module | Week | Read this | Work with these files |
|--------|------|-----------|------------------------|
| **Module 1 — From chat window to command line** | 1 | Videos A1, A2 | `CLAUDE.md`, `MEMORY.md`, `LESSONS.md`, `examples/worked-claude-md/`, `sample-docs/` |
| **Module 2 — Custom skills, commands, hooks, plugins** | 2 | Videos B1, B2 | `skills/`, `.claude/commands/`, `.claude/hooks.json`, `plugin/` |
| **Module 3 — Automation, pipelines, triggered workflows** | 3 | Videos C1, C2 | `scripts/pipeline/`, `.github/workflows/`, `examples/mamdani-mini/` |
| **Module 4 — Advanced prompting patterns** | 4 | Videos D1, D2, D3, D4 | `docs/context-management.md`, `docs/cross-model-review.md`, `docs/four-questions.md` |
| **Final project** | 4 | — | Build something on your beat using anything in the kit |

See [docs/module-map.md](docs/module-map.md) for the full file-to-video index.
