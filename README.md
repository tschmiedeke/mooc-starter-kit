## What this repo is

This is your workspace for the course. It contains:

- A **starter context file** (`CLAUDE.md`) with placeholder sections you'll customize for your beat
- **Sample journalism documents** you'll use in exercises (press releases, meeting minutes, interview notes)
- **Skill templates** you'll modify and extend in Module 2
- **Starter scripts** for the pipeline exercise in Module 3
- **MCP configuration examples** for connecting AI to your documents in Module 4
- An **empty archive folder** where you'll add documents for the Module 4 RAG exercise

By the end of the course, this repo will be a working AI-assisted journalism toolkit — documented, version-controlled, and shareable.

## Getting started

### 1. Fork this repo

Click the **Fork** button at the top right of this page. This creates your own copy on GitHub that you can push to freely.

### 2. Clone your fork

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/mooc-starter-kit.git
cd mooc-starter-kit
```

Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your GitHub username.

### 3. Install the tools

You need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 20+) and at least one AI CLI tool:

| Tool | Install | Cost |
|------|---------|------|
| **Gemini CLI** | `npm install -g @google/gemini-cli` | Free (1,000 req/day with Google account) |
| **Claude Code** | `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` | Requires Claude Max ($20/mo) or API key |
| **Codex CLI** | `npm install -g @openai/codex` | Requires OpenAI API key |

The course exercises use Claude Code, but the concepts apply to all three tools.

### 4. Start the first exercise

Open the [Module 1 exercise](https://mooc.amditis.tech/module-1/) on the course site and follow the instructions.
